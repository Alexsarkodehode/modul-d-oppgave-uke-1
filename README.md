# Modul D Task 1

The first task is simply for setting up a [React] project and learning how to use it to define static (unchanging) components.

## Task

Create a simple Blog Gallery using the [provided data](./src/data/posts.js). Alternativly find your own dataset and display that.

- **Planning**
  1. Import and flesh out this sketch in Figma. It does not need to be detailed, but you need to make decisions about what should be a component, and which variation you want to support.

- **Implementation**
  1. Make a fork of this repository or generate a new one with [ViteJS]
